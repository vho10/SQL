#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers cust

INNER JOIN FebSales Feb ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product
,quantity
,SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) AS cust_more_than_two
, AVG(quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust 
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
